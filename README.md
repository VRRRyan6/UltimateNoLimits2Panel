# UltimateNoLimits2Panel
The ultimate Arduino based control panel for NoLimits 2

This repo is for what I'm hoping to be the best control panel for NL2, including some custom PCB work that will have an ATmega 2560 for I/O and an ATmega 32u4 for keyboard emulation. The repo will be updated as more of the project gets completed.
